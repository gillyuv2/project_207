# Step 1

Code affected: none

Created this file.


#########
# Step 2

Code affected: all .java files

Reformatted using the Google Java style formatter.

#########
# Step 3

Code affected: Pig.turnAround

Flaw: unnecessary if, leading to duplicate code.

Fix: replaced if statement with a single assignment statement.


##########
# Step 4

Code affected: Pig.clearStomach, Human.move, Egg.draw, Chicken.layegg, Chicken.digest

Flaw: unnecessary print statements in the methods. 

Fix: Commented all the print statements.

# Step 5

Code affected: class Wind, Wind.windBlowingUp, Wind.windBlowingDown, class Main

Flaw: 1. Redundant code in methods windBlowingUp and windBlowingLeft, irrelevant doc strings, irrelevant method
         and variable names.
      2. Old names for wind methods.

Fix: 1. Created a general method for choosing the direction of the wind. Changed the name of Wind.windBlowingUp,
        Wind.windBlowingDown to Wind.horizontal and Wind.vertical.
     2. Created new meaningful variable, method names and doc strings. Changed the probablity of wind direction.
     3. Reset names of wind methods with the new ones.

# Step 6

Code affected: new .java file named FarmMethods

Flaw: Repetitive code in other .java files

Fix: Created a super class with methods: 1.setLocation 2.getX 3.getY 4.setColor 5.getColor 6.drawString 7.draw
                                         8.setAppearance 9.getAppearance

##########
# Step 7

Code affected: .java files 1. AnimalManure 2. AnimalFood 3. Egg

Flaw: Unnecessary similar code: 1. Methods: setLocation, draw, drawString 2. Variable: x, y, appearance, colour

Fix: 1. Removed all the above mentioned methods along with their doc strings. Removed all the above mentioned unnecessary
        variables.
     2. Added constructor to Egg class and set its appearance with setAppearance method and set its color with

# Step 8

Code affected: .java files: 1. Human 2. Pig 3. Chicken 4. AnimalFood

Flaw: different method names, calls to public or protected variables y and color and methods.

Fix: 1. Fixed AnimalFood methods: 1.blownUp 2. blownDown 3. blownLeft 4. blownRight
        - removed changes to x and y as previously implemented.
        - used method setLocation and getX and getY and implemented the code to blow food up, down, left and right
          as per method names.
     2. Fixed calls to previously protected variable Y in Human, Pig and Chicken file and changed it with getY()
     3. Changed the calls to previously public variable 'colour' with the method getColor().

##########
# Step 9

Code affected: .java files: 1. Animals 2. Human 3. Pig 4. Chicken

Flaw: 1. Redundant code in Human, Pig and Chicken class.
      2. Methods and class variables are copied and pasted.
      3. Common Errors in the classes.

Fix: 1. Animals class with methods: 1. setManure 2. reverseAppearance 3. turnAround 4. digest.
        -Variables: 1. manure 2. horizontal 3. vertical 4. belly 5. target.
     2. Removed the redundant code from Human, Pig and Chicken.
     3. Replaced old variable names with getters and setters for co-ordinates x and y, color and
        appearance.
     4. Cleaned the redundant variables from the files.
     5. Removed unnecessary and irrelevant doc stings and comments.

##########
# Step 10

Code affected: .java file 1. Main 2. Human 3. Farm 4. Chicken 5. Pig

Flaw: public static array in human that is not useful for human.

Fix: 1. Created the public static array in different class Farm
     2. Changed the instances of the variable Human.myFarmAnimals with Farm.myFarmAnimals in the Human Farm and Chicken
        and Pig.

##########
# Step 11

Code affected: .java file 1. Main 2. Human 3. Farm 4. Chicken 5. Pig

Flaw: public static array in human that is not useful for human.

Fix: 1. Created the public static array in different class Farm
     2. Changed the instances of the variable Human.myFarmAnimals with Farm.myFarmAnimals in the Human Farm and Chicken
        and Pig.
     3. Created static lists that store Egg, AnimalFood and Animal Manure.
     4. These lists will eleminate the need to iterate over the empty array.

#########
# Step 12

Code Affected: .java file 1. Human

Flaw: 1. Eggs were not properly collected.
      2. Eggs were not removed properly from the screen.

Fix: 1. Changed the conditions of reaching target in move method. Added a way to remove the object from the eggList
